Idea2: movie recommendation
Background: I enjoy watching movies a lot. I have a very busy life. I will randomly choose a movie from Netflix or somewhere. Sometimes it ended up I didnâ€™t like the movie and wastes time on filtering movies. I would like to have a machine-learning model based on IMDB movie dataset. Once I told model what I like, it can show me the closest recommendation. 

Data: Kaggle IMDB 5000 Movie dataset.
